Strings are not mutable but references can be changed.

In c , any thing non-zero is true in C and only zero means false
but in java false is not equal to 0 and 1 is not eqal to true.

can we write
Integer z = 20??

In or if the first statement is true then the second statement is not checked.
similarly in and if the first statement is false then second statement is not checked

Difference between (& , &&), (| , ||)??

Why do we use a switch case instead of if?

we can't use continue in switch case - will result in compilation error
